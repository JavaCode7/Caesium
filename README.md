A & B: "This isn't Python; it's..."

# Caesium (C##/Cx/C++++++)
Caesium (pronounced see-zi-um)

NOUN

1. The chemical element of atomic number 55, a soft, silvery, extremely reactive metal. It belongs to the alkali metal group and occurs as a trace element in some rocks and minerals.

2. The programming language that mixes Python's readability with C's functionality. The language that made Python functional with Python.

Caesium is 2 things:

1. My favourite element of the periodic table because it is highly flammable and explosive

2. My first independent programming language 😀

Ok, so it's not that much of a big deal as I am designing Caesium with one main goal in mind: I am going to use it to make other languages.

## To-Do
### Lexer
- [ ] Add a load of other characters (@, £, $, %, ~, #...)
- [ ] Regex expression Lexing

### Parser
- [ ] Fix exprlevel4() to accept negative numbers
- [ ] Add strings and other datatypes

### Compiler, Interpreter and Builtins
- [x] Start Interpreter
- [x] Start Builtins
- [x] Change Interpreter to support Builtins

### Rules
- [ ] Change DEFAULT_PROGRAM_TOKENS to tokens instead of dictionaries and functional instead of object-oriented and actually use them somewhere

Please let me know if you would like to help me with any of this, it would be greatly appreciated.
