Caesium (C##/Cx/C++++++)
=======

Caesium (pronounced see-zi-um)

NOUN

1. The chemical element of atomic number 55, a soft, silvery, extremely reactive metal. It belongs to the alkali metal group and occurs as a trace element in some rocks and minerals.

2. A programming language.
------

Caesium is 2 things:

1. My favourite element of the periodic table because it is highly flammable and explosive

2. My first independent programming language ðŸ˜€

Ok, so it's not that much of a big deal but I am designing Caesium with one main goal in mind: I am going to use it to make other languages.

-----

TO-DO:
* Lexer:
    * Add a load of other characters (@, Â£, $, %, ~, #...)
    * Regex expressions

* Parser

* Compiler

* Rules:
    * Change DEFAULT_PROGRAM_TOKENS to tokens instead of dictionaries and actually use them somewhere

Please let me know if you would like to help me with any of this, it would be greatly appreciated.
