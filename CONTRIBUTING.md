# Contibuting

When contributing make sure to follow these rules:

* Don't change the style of the language. Caesium is supposed to look like Go, Rust and Kotlin with the readability of Python. It is functional and that shouldn't be changed.

* Please don't suggest language design anywhere else but the [Caesium ideas](https://github.com/JavaCode7/Caesium/discussions/1) discussion

* Always follow the rule... <b>console.stdout("be amazing");<b>
